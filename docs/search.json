    "text": "Project 4 focuses on understanding the mechanisms of immune remodeling in cervical cancer (CC) and identifying potential therapeutic targets; paper1, paper2. Cervical cancer progression involves complex interactions between immune cells and tumor cells, leading to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. To investigate these interactions, this study utilizes scRNA-seq data from normal cervix, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and cervical cancer tissues to analyze transcriptional responses in immune cells.\nUnsupervised clustering of transcriptional profiles revealed distinct immune cell populations and their interactions with tumor cells. Differences in immune cell states were linked to the progression of cervical cancer and the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Specifically, the study identified unique HPV-related epithelial clusters and critical node genes that regulate disease progression. The transition from normal cervix to HSIL and cervical cancer was marked by changes in immune cell populations, including T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages.\nFurther analysis identified key immune cell subsets and their roles in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Network analyses demonstrated that immune cell interactions influence functional T cell programs and systemic immune coordination. This study provides insights into how immune remodeling impacts cervical cancer progression and highlights transcriptional markers that could be used to predict patient outcomes and guide therapeutic strategies."

Flies were exposed to cocaine, which impaired locomotor activity and increased the incidence of seizures and compulsive grooming. To investigate the specific cell populations responding to cocaine, single-cell transcriptional responses were analyzed in duplicate samples of flies that consumed sucrose or sucrose supplemented with cocaine. The study utilized the 10x Genomics Chromium platform for single-cell RNA sequencing.\nUnsupervised clustering of transcriptional profiles from 86,224 cells revealed 36 distinct clusters, representing all major cell types (neuronal and glial) and neurotransmitter types from most brain regions. Differential expression analysis within individual clusters indicated cluster-specific responses to cocaine, with Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies and glia showing particularly large transcriptional changes. The study highlighted profound sexual dimorphism in brain transcriptional responses to cocaine, with males exhibiting more pronounced changes than females.\nCluster-specific coexpression networks and global interaction networks revealed diverse cellular processes affected by acute cocaine exposure, providing an atlas of sexually dimorphic cocaine-modulated gene expression in the Drosophila brain."

These exercises are not essential to run for the rest of the course, so you can skip them. If you want to do them anyway, you can try to install cellranger locally (only on Linux or WSL). In addition, you will need to download the references. You can get it by with this code (choose your OS):\n\nLinux/MacOS/WSLWindows\n\n\nwget https://single-cell-transcriptomics.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cellranger_index.tar.gz\ntar -xvf cellranger_index.tar.gz\nrm cellranger_index.tar.gz\n\n\nDownload using the link, and unpack in your working directory.\n\n\n\nThis will download and extract the index in the current directory. Specify the path to this reference in the exercises accordingly.\n\n\nHave a look in the directory course_data/reads and /data/cellranger_index. In the reads directory you will find reads on one sample: ETV6-RUNX1_1. In the analysis part of the course we will work with six samples, but due to time and computational limitations we will run cellranger count on one of the samples, and only reads originating from chromsome 21 and 22.\nThe input you need to run cellranger count are the sequence reads and a reference. Here, we have prepared a reference only with chromosome 21 and 22, but in ‘real life’ you would of course get the full reference genome of your species. The reference has a specific format. You can download precomputed human and mouse references from the 10X website. If your species of interest is not one of those, you will have to generate it yourself. For that, have a look here.\nTo be able to run cellranger in the compute environment, first run:\nexport PATH=/data/cellranger-9.0.1:$PATH\nHave a look at the documentation of cellranger count (scroll down to Command-line argument reference).\nYou can find the input files here:\n\nreads: /home/rstudio/single_cell_course/course_data/reads/ (from the downloaded tar package in your home directory)\npre-indexed reference: /data/cellranger_index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nFill out the missing arguments (at FIXME) in the script below, and run it:\ncellranger count \\\n--id=FIXME \\\n--sample=FIXME \\\n--transcriptome=FIXME \\\n--fastqs=FIXME \\\n--localcores=4 \\\n--create-bam=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will take a while..\n\n\n\nOnce started, the process will need approximately 15 minutes to finish. Have a coffee and/or have a look at the other exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning a bash command with Rstudio\n\n\n\nYou can run a bash script or command using the terminal tab in Rstudio server:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\ncellranger count \\\n--id=ETV6-RUNX1_1 \\\n--sample=ETV6-RUNX1_1 \\\n--transcriptome=/data/cellranger_index \\\n--fastqs=/home/rstudio/single_cell_course/course_data/reads \\\n--localcores=4 \\\n--create-bam=true\n\n\n\nHave a look out the output directory (i.e. ~/ETV6-RUNX1_1/outs). The analysis report (web_summary.html) is usually a good place to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen html files in Rstudio server\n\n\n\nYou can use the file browser in the bottom right (tab “Files”) to open html files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nHave a good look inside web_summary.html. Anything that draws your attention? Is this report good enough to continue the analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nNot really. First of all there is a warning: Fraction of RNA read bases with Q-score &gt;= 30 is low. This means that there is a low base quality of the reads. A low base quality gives results in more sequencing error and therefore possibly lower performance while mapping the reads to genes. However, a Q-score of 30 still represents 99.9% accuracy.\nWhat should worry us more is the number of reads per cell (363) and the sequencing saturation (7.9%). In most cases you should aim for 30.000 - 50.000 reads per cell (depending on the application). We therefore don’t have enough reads per cell. However, as you might remember, this was a subset of reads (1 million) mapped against chromosome 21 & 22, while the original dataset contains 210,987,037 reads. You can check out the original report at course_data/count_matrices/ETV6-RUNX1_1/outs/web_summary.html.\nFor more info on sequencing saturation, have a look here."

Note that you will need administrator rights, and that if you are using Windows, you need the latest version of Windows 10.\n\nThe command to run the environment required for this course looks like this (in a terminal):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify the script\n\n\n\nThe home directory within the container is mounted to your current directory ($PWD), if you want to change this behaviour, modify the path after -v to the working directory on your computer before running it.\n\n\n\ndocker run \\\n--rm \\\n-p 8787:8787 \\\n-e PASSWORD=test \\\n-v $PWD:/home/rstudio \\\ngeertvangeest/single-cell-rstudio:latest\n\nIf this command has run successfully, approach Rstudio server like this:\nhttp://localhost:8787\nCopy this URL into your browser. If you used the snippet above, the credentials will be:\n\nUsername: rstudio\nPassword: test\n\nGreat! Now you will be able to use Rstudio with all required installations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the options\n\n\n\nThe option -v mounts a local directory in your computer to the directory /home/rstudio in the docker container (‘rstudio’ is the default user for Rstudio containers). In that way, you have files available both in the container and on your computer. Use this directory on your computer. Change the first path to a path on your computer that you want to use as a working directory.\nThe part geertvangeest/single-cell-rstudio:latest is the image we are going to load into the container. The image contains all the information about software and dependencies needed for this course. When you run this command for the first time it will download the image. Once it’s on your computer, it will start immediately.\n\n\n\n\nTo simply run the environment, you can use renku. You can find the repository (including the image) here: https://renkulab.io/projects/geert.vangeest/single-cell-training/.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a project\nNow that you have access to an environment with the required installations, we will set up a project in a new directory.

This should be single_cell_course. Finish by clicking Create Project.\n\nNow that we have setup a project and a project directory (it is in /home/rstudio/single_cell_course), we can download the data that is required for this course. We will use the built-in terminal of Rstudio.

Type I interferons play a dual role in cancer immunotherapy, promoting both anti-tumor immunity and immune suppression through T cell exhaustion. To investigate how pre-existing IFN-I responses influence therapeutic success, this study utilizes scRNA-seq data from healthy donors and 8 treated patients to analyze transcriptional responses in immune cells.\nUnsupervised clustering of transcriptional profiles revealed distinct immune cell populations and IFN-I-induced responses. Differences in IFN-I responsiveness were linked to immune cell states and transcriptional programs that influence therapy outcomes. Patients with lower pre-therapy IFN-I responsiveness in CD4 and CD8 effector T cells (Teff cells) exhibited transcriptional signatures associated with improved immune function, whereas highly responsive Teff cells displayed gene expression patterns linked to immune dysfunction and therapy resistance.\nFurther analysis identified epigenetically imprinted IFN-I response states that predefine immune reactivity to therapy. Coexpression and network analyses demonstrated that IFN-I responsiveness influences functional T cell programs and systemic immune coordination. This study provides insights into how pre-existing immune states impact therapeutic success and highlights transcriptional markers that could be used to predict patient outcomes in PD1 blockade immunotherapy."
